# MESSAGES CUSTOMIZATION:
#
#   Edit the messages of the plugin as you like. You can change the language, colors and almost everything
#   you imagine! If there's a message you want to translate, and it isn't here, you can request it to be
#   translatable by opening a feature request here:
#   https://github.com/devblook/akropolis/issues/new?assignees=zetastormy&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=A+brief+description+of+your+request
#--------
# MESSAGE FORMATTING:
#
#   The plugin uses MiniMessage to format the chat,
#   so you can use tags to color messages, like this: <red> Red colored message!
#   You can also use HEX colors in an easy way, just like this: <#00ff00>R G B!
#
#   More information about MiniMessage can be found here: https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html
#   There's also an online MiniMessage Viewer available: https://webui.adventure.kyori.net/
